## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated test coverage for introduced exercise-page changes
The system SHALL include automated tests for service behavior and page integration introduced by this change, and those tests MUST validate behavior through public APIs and observable outcomes rather than source-file text inspection.

#### Scenario: ExerciseConfigService is tested
- **WHEN** test suites are executed
- **THEN** tests verify listing exercises and resolving exercise configuration by id, including not-found outcomes, through public service API calls

#### Scenario: Exercise page integration is tested
- **WHEN** test suites are executed
- **THEN** tests verify valid-id rendering and invalid/missing-id error-page behavior through component interaction and rendered output assertions

#### Scenario: Exercise runtime lifecycle and key capture are tested
- **WHEN** test suites are executed
- **THEN** tests verify lifecycle state transitions, start/pause button-label switching, temporary completion transition, and running-state key capture/display via observable page behavior

#### Scenario: Exercise tests avoid implementation-text assertions
- **WHEN** exercise-page requirements tests are authored or maintained
- **THEN** they do not load source files to assert the presence of specific code fragments
