## Why

The goal is to establish a robust foundation for a keyboard typing learning application. By creating a well-structured skeleton webapp, we enable incremental development of typing exercises and educational features without having to rebuild the core infrastructure later. Starting with a simple "Hello" page provides an immediate validation point that the basic web infrastructure is working correctly.

## What Changes

- **New web application project** - Initialize a modern webapp with standard build tooling and project structure
- **Basic HTTP server** - Serve a simple HTML page  
- **Hello page** - Display a minimal page with "Hello" as a proof of concept
- **Project foundation** - Set up version control, documentation, and development workflow for future exercise features

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `webapp-core`: Core web application infrastructure and basic page serving
- `hello-page`: A simple landing page displaying "Hello"

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No existing specs are being modified -->

## Impact

- **New code repository structure** - Project will follow standard webapp conventions
- **Development environment** - Backend and frontend development environment setup
- **Dependencies** - Initial web framework and tooling selection
- **Future extensibility** - Architecture designed to support adding typing exercises, user progress tracking, and exercise management in subsequent changes
